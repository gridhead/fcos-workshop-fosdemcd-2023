# Fedora CoreOS - Your Next Multiplayer Homelab Distro
*Using Fedora CoreOS in a Selfhosted Homelab to setup a Multiplayer Server*

This repository contains the assets related to the "Fedora CoreOS - Your Next 
Multiplayer Homelab Distro" talk on FOSDEM 2023 Containers Devroom

More information can be found [here](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/container_fedora_coreos/).

## Speakers

* **Akashdeep Dhar**  
  Objective Lead for Fedora Websites & Apps, Fedora Council  
  Software Engineer, Red Hat Community Platform Engineering  

* **Sumantro Mukherjee**  
  Elected Representative, Fedora Council  
  Software Quality Engineer, Red Hat  

## Introduction

Fedora CoreOS is a basic, monolithic, automatically updating operating system 
that is optimised for running containers. It focuses on offering the best 
container host for executing containerized workloads securely and at scale. 
This fits perfectly the requirement for setting up a container-oriented 
self-hosted homelab and in this talk, we would detail that and go one (or more 
steps) further by providing a case study of setting up Fedora CoreOS as a 
self-hosted homelab distribution for globally accessible (using secure network 
tunnelling) multiplayer servers for video games (namely, Minecraft, Valheim 
etc.).

## Who is the target audience?

1. **Professional sysadmins** who use Fedora CoreOS but want to know more 
   applications
2. **Budding community members** wanting to contribute to the upstream projects
3. **GNU/Linux distribution** users who are on the fence, about trying a 
   different workflow
4. **Video game enthusiasts** who run (or plan to run) their dedicated 
   multiplayer servers
5. **Self-hosted homelab followers** who maintain a home infrastructure as a 
   hobby
6. **Software engineers** or **students** who wish to learn sysadminship with 
   Fedora CoreOS

## How is the target audience benefited?

1. **Professional sysadmins** (who already use Fedora CoreOS or similar 
   distros) would learn about other creative applications like running a 
   multiplayer server.
2. **Budding community members** would know how they can contribute to the 
   upstream projects that provide a well-suited container-oriented distro.
3. **GNU/Linux distribution users** would be helped with their decision by 
   knowing the difference between the workflows used in regular distros and 
   that in Fedora CoreOS.
4. **Video game enthusiasts** would get bragging rights among their friends 
   once understand (and apply) how to set up a multiplayer server seamlessly.
5. **Self-hosted homelab followers** would obtain more insights on possible 
   alternative operating systems like Fedora CoreOS for their current 
   infrastructure setup.
6. **Software engineers** or **students** would gain more information on where 
   they can start from within the community (i.e. Fedora Infrastructure) with 
   their learnings.
